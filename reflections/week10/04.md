## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

- An enum is a sharply defined constant.  They are used to assign symbolic names to integral values.  This is very useful in categorization.  

2. How can you modify an Enum?

- You can use a switch statement.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

- I have not used them yet, but I see the use in AllSpice.  I will be sorting recipes by "category" and assigning different background images based on category.  This seems to be a perfect use of enums.
