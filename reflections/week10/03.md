## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

- A row is all the information about an entry in the table, a column is one type of information from all entries.  

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

- CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  name VARCHAR(255)
  age VARCHAR(255)
  description VARCHAR(255)
  id INT
)

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

- DELETE FROM removes items from the table, while DROP TABLE deletes the entire table.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- Instead of finishing the chores application I linked the sql db up in gregslist.  Some of the sql grammar is a little tricky, but it seems that strict type languages are easier to find answers for on google.  With Node there were many ways to do something, with C# and SQL there seems to be ONE.
