## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

- Value type, reference type and pointer type.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

- There are a lot! I immediately notice that number is now int and bool is still bool.  However beyond those all the types seem new.  I'm guessing char is for character and enum is enumerator.  The scope of value types seems different as well.  Variables being passed from one method to another and manipulated doesn't change the original value.  Almost like the variable has global scope, unless passed to a method.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

- Reference types are stored in one place and the variable is merely an address.  In the value type the variable is the value.  They are one thing, while reference you only get to manipulate the address of the data.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- Postman remains cool.  C# feels like a natural progression from the work we have already done.  I know I've said this before, but I feel like I got this one pretty quickly.  Still waiting for the other shoe to drop on Tuesday.  Some of the syntax is different, but the CRUD remains essentially the same.
