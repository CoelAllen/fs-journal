# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- Group project was really fun! Initial planning was key to success.  Our first couple hours went really smoothly just because of 20 minutes worth of planning thursday night.  We certainly needed a good bit of help from the TAs but all in all I think we did a really good job.
