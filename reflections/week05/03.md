## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

- Timeboxing is breaking your time up into manageable chunks.  Especially when hitting a snag

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

- Strategic Quitting, doing half time and PRACTICE! Stepping away for a even a few moments helps reset and the concept of time getting filled by a task is so obvious.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

- Its kinda like when you get the answer to a problem in the car on the way home.  When your brain stops worrying about it often thats when it makes sense.
