## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

- A way to link a page or template to another.  This "nests" the templates within the page.
 
2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

- When referencing a different component or when information has the same template, but the info inside changes. 

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

- You can! It would be useful if you were passing and id or another bit of info.  I think this is what props are for.

- Surprise! Extra day for checkpoint.  I am still not super confident with Vue.  I will miss the Thursday Fireside, but perhaps I was relying too much on it.
