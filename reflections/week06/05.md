# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- Things are certainly speeding up.  I felt like I learned more from actually getting into the checkpoint than I did all week.  Obviously thats not the case, but the amount of AHA! moments I've had this weekend were crazy.  I had all the pieces floating around in my brain, but getting them to connect was a whole other thing.  I'm pretty proud of myself this week.  I am also terribly indebted to the staff.  They helped me out tremendously over the week.
