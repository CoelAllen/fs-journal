## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

- It passes down information from one class to another instead of making a whole new class.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

- All members of a base class are inherited.  The class that inherits is the derived class.  Derived classes can inherit from the same class without inheriting or being the same as each other.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

- It limits the scope of the inheritance.  Private accessibility can only be accessed by classes nested within the base class.  Publicly accessible classes are available through the public interface. There are also protected, abstract and internally accessible that have varying levels of accessibility.
