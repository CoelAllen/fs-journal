## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

- Coming back to an educational environment later in life delivered many interesting challenges, especially knowing previous graduates that are considerably younger.  While the people around me maintained that I could understand and excel in this course I had doubts.  Now looking back I realize my age benefitted me, this is a class I would not have passed at 18.  

  Jake lectures well. He brings energy and excitement to what could easily be dry subjects.  The assignments move at a rapid, yet deliberate pace.  While my body of knowledge remains small, my ability to learn, my educability (<- one of my favorite words), has skyrocketed.  Learning sql, c# and dotnet in two weeks is frankly unbelievable, but that's where this course excels: Teaching how to learn development.  I am confident I could jump into any framework and pick it up faster than I ever could on my own or in a more traditional learning environment. 

On a less serious note, its not often I can enter an environment like this.  The class is great and it really brought me out of my comfort zone and I think I have made some real friends here.
