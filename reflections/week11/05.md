# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- The nearly audible "click" as I wrote a successful complex sql query in lab represented a ton of struggle and a very powerful AHA! moment.  I am confident I will do well with the final.  I have to remember to explicitly name my ids!
