## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

- A primary key is the main identifier of a table while a foreign key is the relative identifier to the related value in another table.  The comparable value in a relationship.

2. What is an `Alias`?

- An alias is a usually shorter or clearer name given to a value or table.  

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
- SELECT 
    p.*,
    d.*
    FROM patients p
    JOIN doctors d ON d.patientId = p.id
    WHERE d.id = id

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- More review! I am going to miss lecture.  I think things have clicked pretty hard for me.  Many to many relationships are making more sense.  It helps to visualize or "flatten" the joined tables.
