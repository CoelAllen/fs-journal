## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

- The three states are pending, fulfilled and rejected.

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

- If you wrap your code in a promise instead of getting null or undefined values that pass through functions, you can have different functions await the data and if it is fulfilled the code moves on and if it is rejected you can have a separate function occur, like a pop error!

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

- With a .then statement if there is an error it goes unhandled.  While a .catch grabs the error and does whatever you coded it to do, like pop an error code or issue an alert.

- The pattern is beginning to emerge!  Comparing this to the original gregslist certainly shows how useful this could be.  Its still very hazy however and the syntax is confusing.
