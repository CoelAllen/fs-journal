## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

- They allow functions to use promises to call to other data or areas of code and then not progress until the promise is fulfilled or rejected.  This cleans up you code and allows functions to run parallel.

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

- You must mark the function with an 'async' and the function must call to a service that handles the function.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

- To simplify! They allow functions to run independently rather than top-down like a standard javascript file.

- To be honest this one broke me.  I thought I had a handle on it, but that clearly wasn't the case.  The way the files talk to each other is difficult to grasp and, again, I can't write the syntax without heavy reference.  It is funny how the CSS and HTML parts are becoming easier and easier.  What once seemed near-impossible is now do-able.
