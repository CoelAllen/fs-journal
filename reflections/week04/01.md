> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

- A good indicator of callback hell is the pyramid shape of a bunch of )}s.  It is cause by trying to make your complex code run from top-to-bottom.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

- Asynchronous means data is sent and received to a server.  The callback function can then run the code in the background.  The function has to wait (aka await) for the ran code to continue.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

- Splitting your functions into several controllers can organize your code so each file has a specific responsibility, rather than one huge file.  Using async and await to allow your different functions to pull or push data in separate places so code can run simultaneously. You can also use promises to return values in the future, rather than tying up your code with a bunch of extra requirements and catch errors as they occur.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- Once again a new concept has emerged that blows my mind.  I can see how splitting up functions between several files is better, but the order of operation complicates thing nicely.
