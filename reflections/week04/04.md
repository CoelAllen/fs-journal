## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

- Representational State Transfer. It is the flow if info between clients and servers.  It allows code to be changed on either side without disrupting the service on the other side.  Using four simple terms : GET, POST, PUT and DELETE you can change the info, regardless of the client.

2. What does Stateless mean?

- The server and client do not need to know about each other to interact following some simple protocols. Resources can be edited or saved regardless of architecture or operating system.  

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

- a base URL followed by an endpoint.  So "https://bcw-sandbox.herokuapp.com/" is the base URL and '/api/gift' would be an endpoint.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- Working with someone else was very helpful.  Especially doing a project that was pretty silly.  It was fun and helped firm up the syntax problems I've been having.  PUT and POST make a lot more sense now.
