# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- The Thursday fireside saved my bacon this week.  Watching Jake speed run the pokedex really locked into place the order of communication.  I think the observer pattern...? Jumping in to the checkpoint was not nearly as scary as I thought.  I immediately succeeded on aspects where I failed earlier in the week.  Now I'm flipping between controllers, services and models comfortably.  I am still struggling with some of the syntax, but that is just a practice issue.  Typos have also become my greatest fear.  Misplaced 's's derailed me several times this week.  Naming conventions are another practice issue for me.
