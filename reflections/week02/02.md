## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

- The first way is to write "function" and then the parameter and then the actual function to be completed, or "function declaration. The second is just writing the function starting with a let statement. As in: "let variable= function..." This is function expression. The third is an arrow function, where, starting with variables, the arrow would replace the word function and then the {}.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

- Parameters are a variable in a function. An argument is the specific data you pass into the parameters. You define the parameter, but you make the argument.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

- A higher order function is one that uses another function as an argument, or returns a function as its result. An example would be filter(). This runs a function for each element and then also re-writes the array just using the results of the first function.
