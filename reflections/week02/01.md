## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

- Scope is essentially the range of use of the variable. Whether it is over the whole block or within a specific function.

2. What is Hoisting ?

- Hoisting is where constants, let or variables are moved to the top of their scope.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

- I would use var fo a variable that is used over the whole code. I would use const for a variable that cannot be changed, but may only be used in one block of code. Let I would use for a variable that may be updated within a block.
