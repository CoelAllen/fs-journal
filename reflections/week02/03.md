## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

- Console.log is the what I use the most. It sends a message to the console when the function it is placed in runs. You can also type directly into the console to run functions or request information. The console also shows errors which is really fun.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

- Elements is the tab. It is super useful because you can check div by div exactly whats going on.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

- Using the debugger command is really useful. It stops the code at the place you put the debugger command. This lets you go through the code line by line and see if there are any errors.
