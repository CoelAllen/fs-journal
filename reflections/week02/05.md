# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This week has been a series of aha moments. My biggest takeaway has been planning and communicating with myself. Console.log and comments are super useful and I am trying to create those habits. The actual logic of JavaScript is difficult, but is much more manageable with a plan and notes. I am now using comments for every section and every function. I have been hand drawing assignments before typing word one. Once everything is more or less laid out the rest kinda falls into place. Commenting and logging functions has made things make so much more sense.
