## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?

- It is testing components of software for errors before implementing.  You should test the smallest units of code you can to ensure all the pieces work together and errors can be discovered early.

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

- You can find errors fast and early. Testing during development also acts as a "first line of defense".  Since the coders are the first to make the code it makes sense for them to test as they go, saving time in the long run. It also improves the general architecture of the system since the developers are thinking of way the code can be run incorrectly as they edit.

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

- It can slow down the development process.  Also without proper documentation, the results may be meaningless to another developer.  It can also be difficult to convince management to support testing outside of QA.
