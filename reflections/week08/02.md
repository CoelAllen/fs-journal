## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

- It is easy to sidetracked into solo projects.  If anything changes, or a problem comes up, everyone will need to know because it could impact everyone's work.  

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

- Making communication broader than just regular stand-ups. Since you are in a small team, communicating effectively on the ground can limit the need for more "official" meetings that slow everything down.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

- The unattainable triangle: you can have it fast, cheap or good, pick two.  Doing something fast can give you more time after deployment to fix any issues.  It also keeps stakeholders happy if they have marketable products fast.  Cheap's benefits are  fairly self-explanatory.  Less cost = more profit.  Good is a tricky one.  It costs the most or takes the most time.  But as Shigeru Miyamoto said, "Ad delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad."
