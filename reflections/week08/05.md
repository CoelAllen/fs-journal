# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- Group projects are hard!  I think we/re working well together, but it is difficult because often an issue for one or two people because a full blown discussion.  I think we all have equal buy-in, but that means we all have input and things can get bogged down.  I am fortunate to be on such a talented team and I am already learning a lot.
