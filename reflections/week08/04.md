## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

- Unit Testing, Component Testing and End-to-End.  Unit testing allows you to test small units of code individually, this give you the confidence that your new features will remain stable as they are changed or added to.  Component testing mounts components to either real or virtual DOMS to see if they are working realiably.  E2E tests validate all of your code, from the DOM to the backend.  This fully explores what happens with a users experience.  

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

- As a beginner I find unit testing the most useful.  Making sure the smallest parts are working and adding from there is a very effective way to code.  However when something isn't working and I have trouble understanding why, I take a very holistic view and usually follow the information all the way from the server, so in a E2E way.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

- Component testing is tough.  I am not generally confident enough to not be testing constantly and like I said above, when things go really wrong I tend to jump straight to E2E.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

- Planning is key! I feel as though our group was very good at planning our UML and different Schema's and related components, but because our Figma was lacking we are hazy on the look and feel of our App.  Jake gave a very good mini-lecture about "user stories" that made things much more clear for me.  Hopefully we get things moving in the right direction.
