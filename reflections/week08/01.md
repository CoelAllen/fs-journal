## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

- It gives employers a chance to see what quality work you have done in the past.  I also gives you a chance to show off what projects you are really proud of and think make you hireable.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

- Quality! Having fewer projects is not a problem as long as the projects shine.  Takin special care to include projects that show off a particular area of expertise.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

- I think with a few tweaks, tow would be a good one to include.  I am hoping that LegoTrader gets there.  Its a subject I'm knowledgeable about and we're trying some new things.  I am going to try to tackle a full vue version of gregslist that I think will look real nice.
