## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

- a Pseudo-class is a style that is dependent of an external factor like a click or refresh. I know :hover and :checked were in the pre-course stuff so I figure we will use those often. 

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

- Specificity is how you how you "rate" what styles are applied to an element when adding class or style changes.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

- When everything is important, nothing is.
