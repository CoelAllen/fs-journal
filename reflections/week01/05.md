# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- I really thought the partner project went well.  It helped firm up quite a bit of the concepts from cool-site and the pre-course work.  It also gave me a good bit of prep work for the first checkpoint.  I also liked working with Kevin.  Having an extra set of eyes made the process less guess and check.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

- The whole row and columns aspect was a revelation. Coming from the restaurant industry this concept is very familiar.  We just call them hotel pans.  They are split into 1/9th, 1/6th, 1/3rd and half pans.  It made visualizing much easier.

- What are you struggling with?

- I still am having some problems with controlling organization within rows and columns. The Aligns and Justifys feel great when they work, but I still not 100%.

- What would you count as a victory?

- When I got some divs to reorder on mobile using a media tag I literally shouted, "YES!"in the lab.  It was worth all the frustration for that moment.
