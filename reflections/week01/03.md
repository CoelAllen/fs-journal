## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

- adjusting things in the inspect tab before applying it to your code

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

- The bootstrap website definitely is a go to.  Its examples, while simple, show what clean code can do.  Dev.to has also come up a good bit with collections of good websites to look at.  Also there are many subreddits that I have been frequently visiting.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

- A poorly designed website is immediately obvious.  If they can't get their website to run effectively what else ***can't*** they do? An attractive and easy-to-use website also makes products seem more attractive and user-friendly.

- Flex-boxes are harder than they look, but are extremely useful.  Also using the devtools is super handy. Its great to mock out and experiment without having to go through a bunch of cmd-z.
