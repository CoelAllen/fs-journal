## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

- Wire-framing is used to block out the design of your site, add color palettes and images and block out any functionality between areas of the page.  Its also good to get an idea of the difference in appearance between mobile and desktop views.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

- High, mid and low fidelity.  Low fidelity is useful for blocking out the base design of a website.  Mid-fidelity is good for beginning to add images and more UX elements.  High-fidelity is a mock-up of the final site.  This is useful to give the engineers a clearer idea of what the designers are looking for.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

- They are absolutely worth it.  I am a very visual person and a tool to draw everything out will save me a ton of heartache.
