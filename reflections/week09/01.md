## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

- We are using Lucid Flowcharts for our UML and we are making a Figma. For the project itself the big thing will be notifications and trade objects.  We will have to use sockets to make them update live and that is something we haven't gon over in class.  

2. What went well so far?

- I think our planning of the backend and the relationships we will need to have a functional front end went really well.  We have a very detailed flow chart and it has really helped with our virtuals, schemas and models.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

- FIGMA! Our figma wasn't very fleshed out and it really made things tough as we moved out of the back end and into the front.  It also made it difficult to realize our user stories.

- Planning is important!  It is sometimes difficult to find the thread of a project, especially when working in a group and doubly so after a weekend.
