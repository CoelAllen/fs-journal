## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?

- A small file that establishes an encrypted link between a client and server.

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

- Encryption, validation and domain number. These are broken down into domain, organization and extended validation in the first two cases and single, multi-domain and wildcard in the latter. Extended validation shows important information about the business in the address bar to protect against spam websites.  Organization ensures that the organization and domain validation are real.  Domain validation is the least expensive and secure and only shows that you have the right to own that domain.

3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

- It secures information sent between client and server.  This can include billing data and personal info.  It also affects google search results.  So not only will you protect your clients you'll also get more traffic!
