## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

- An image that had been encoded into a text format to minimize image requests.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

- It adds to you CPU workload by requiring the extra step of decoding, it adds up to 25% to the file's size and also makes it difficult for users and search engines to get links back to your site since they aren't urls, but encoded images. 

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

- Originally there were strict limits on the number of concurrent connections with a server.  In this case it makes sense to encode images directly into HTML and bypass another connection.  However since HTTP has become so much more efficient at delivering files, Base64 has become somewhat obsolete.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

- Today I am working on live chat.  It was recommended to get it hard coded before attempting sockets.  Not having the site hosted makes it difficult.  It ended up being very do-able and the most difficult part was incorporating an offcanvas to hold the chat.  We needed some help with that, but got to learn a few new tricks.
