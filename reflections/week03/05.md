# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- Tuesday was rough.  This was the first week that felt like bootcamp and I left lab Tuesday afternoon not very confident.  Frankly I was lost.  Using the bcw create Wednesday with gregslist and focusing more on the logic behind what was happening, rather than the particular syntax, helped me turn the corner.  I have been working exclusively from my notes this week, rather than relying on the course's GitHub.  This has hammered home the ordering of files and how they interact.  I only use the lecture examples for specific issues, mostly my poor memory for specifics.
