## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

- It keeps users from accessing functions that may not be for them.  It also allows you to export the same piece of information to several places.

2. How does export differ from export default?

- Exports can export several values.  An export default is only one export per module.  It is the main export of the module, whether it is a value, function or object.  

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

- The biggest benefit seems to be protection of your code.  It sets a specific order of modules leading to App.js which is then the only file accessible from an inspect screen.
