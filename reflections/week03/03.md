## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

- Get and return.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

- You have to use a trap override to make a handler.  The handler accesses a proxy object to return the info.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

- you can make properties of objects private.  I think this is making a POJO rather than a true object.  I could be wrong, but that feels right.
