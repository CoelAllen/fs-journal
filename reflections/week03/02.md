## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

- Encapsulation gives your data protection from users.  It also allows you to change aspects of data without having to reorganize the whole of the app.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

- An underscore prefix seems to be a private function, but it isn't truly encapsulated.  Closure-based encapsulation truly prevent end users from accessing encapsulated information.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

- If you put the variable within a function so that without the function call, the variables cannot be accessed.  You can also use "this" within a method.  This keeps the information private within the method.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- My biggest takeaway is that this is a whole can of worms.  I can vaguely get the flow of info between pages, but it is still a lot to hold in my head.  I hope that with dome practice I will better understand the logic.
