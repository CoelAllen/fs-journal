# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- I passed.  This week was a toughie.  It was the first project I didn't get a duck.  I am proud of this project, I got it looking really sharp.  I did have some issues with functionality and I did got right to the wire on Friday afternoon.  I think I did a pretty good job, but I could have done some things better.
