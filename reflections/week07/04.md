## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

- Well we didn't have a partner project.  I've been thinking a lot about the UX reading.  I started my front-end today and with the new requirements it been on my mind.

2. What went well this week?

- Postman is cool!

3. What would you do differently?

- in hindsight I should of requested a tutor session.  I am struggling with some of the aspects of the Vue model.  I have usually had more "AHA" moments by now.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- Again, no project, but following the project from the back-end to the front, I have a better idea of how much functions will look.  I don't need to keep doublechecking an API because I have an endpoint reference right there in Postman and I already wrote that stuff!
