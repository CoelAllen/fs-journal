## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

- Code documentation is simply writing documentation describing your code, what it does and what your thought processes were when you wrote it.  You can use a README file, a howto or even documenting directly in the source code.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

- Sometimes you can't remember what you did! It also brings other developers up to speed on your code.  In a larger workgroup other people will be accessing your code and it is important for them to understand what it is doing. 

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

- Code documentation is very important! It can help you organize your code before you write it and lay out what the code is expecting as inputs and giving as outputs.  I didn't realize that I've been doing it by writing myself notes throughout my projects!
