**3.** What are the `SOLID` principles?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
- Single-responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion. So in order: Classes should only have one responsibility, Objects should be open for adding to, but not modification, Every subclass could be substituted for their parent class, don't force methods that do not belong with the interface and
```

**4.** Given this array:

```js
let fruit = ["apple", "banana", "pineapple", "orange", "strawberry"];
```

What index is the pineapple's current position? How do you know?

```

**5.** With these two objects:

```js
let you = { name: "You", hair: true, friends: [] };
let them = { name: "Them", hair: false, friends: [] };
```

how would you .push the `them` object into the `you` object's array of friends?

```

**11.** What is the difference between a `primitive` value and a `reference` value?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
- a primitive value is a directly given variable like let x=3.  A reference value is attached to an object in an array.  Like let me[{name: Coel}].
```
